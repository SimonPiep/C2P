# C2P
This project was made in proceedings of the Febreeze Hack Home.
Its focus group are muslim people who need to be reminded of their prayer times.
Those prayer times change day by day and are therefore hard to track, even for experienced muslims.
Google Home will tell you when a prayer time is. Also it will scent your living room with a special scent trhough Febreeze Home. Additionally the green light of the Febreeze Home will be turned on during prayer time. 
It will spiritually connect Febreeze Home and Google Home to over 1.5 billion human beings.
We hope to make the life of these people a bit more easy and hope to increase their life quality (up to 15%).
