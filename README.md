ATHAN. 
This project was made in proceedings of the Febreeze Hack Home.
Its focus group are Muslims who want to be aware of their prayer times.
We live in a very fast paced world where keeping track of recurrent events can be a difficult task.
Especially because those prayer times change day by day and are therefore even harder to track, 
even for experienced muslims.
Google Home will tell you when a prayer time is. 
Also it will scent your living room with a special scent through Febreeze Home. 
Additionally the green light of the Febreeze Home will be turned on during prayer time. 
It will spiritually connect Febreeze Home and Google Home to over 1.5 billion human beings.
We hope to make the life of those people a bit more easy and increase their life quality (up to 15%).
